## About

GeoGraph Node transforms physical documents, artifacts, and locations into structured, AI-ready training data. Using Google's Gemini 3 Flash for intelligent extraction, the platform creates rich knowledge graphs, preserves GIS context, and enables fractional data ownership.

### Use Cases

- **Digital Archives:** Transform massive paper collections into searchable, relational knowledge graphs.
- **AI/ML Training:** Generate high-quality, ethically sourced training datasets for specialized LLMs.
- **Historical Research:** Automatically link entities (People, Places, Dates) across different document sources.
- **Field Documentation:** Catalog items in the field with real-time AR scanning and location metadata.
