# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-01-07

### Added
- **Engine Upgrade:** Migrated to `gemini-2.5-flash` for blazing fast complex text reasoning and better entity extraction in messy scans.
- **Graph Visualizer Panning/Zooming:** Integrated `d3.zoom` into the `GraphVisualizer` component, enabling users to explore dense knowledge graphs via mouse/touch.
- **Structured DB Clusters:** Added a hierarchical "Cluster View" to the database tab, allowing grouping by Source, GIS Zone, Category, or Rights.
- **Cloud Refresh Logic:** Explicit "Refresh Cloud" button in Master View to force-pull latest dataframes from Supabase.
- **Relational Integrity:** Enhanced the Supabase fetching service to reconstruct D3-compatible nodes and links from flattened SQL records.

### Changed
- **Database Default View:** Set "Tabular View" as the default view for the database tab for better data density.
- **Metadata Labels:** Replaced the "Rights" column in the main database table with "Description" to prioritize semantic content visibility.
- **Collection Naming:** Integrated Gemini-suggested collection names to replace the generic "Batch Ingest" label.

### Fixed
- **Image Persistence:** Resolved a race condition where blob URLs were not being converted to permanent storage URLs fast enough for local persistence.
- **TypeScript Strictness:** Added missing types and `@ts-ignore` markers for `import.meta.env` access in non-Vite contexts.

### Added

### Added
