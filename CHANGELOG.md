## [1.8.1] - 2025-12-23

### Fixed
- **UUID Validation Error:** Switched from short random strings to standard UUID v4 for all asset and record identifiers. This resolves `22P02` errors in Supabase when columns are configured as `UUID` type.

### Changed
- **Global Schema Standardization:** Migrated all database column names to UPPERCASE to resolve PostgREST case-sensitivity issues and ensure consistent query behavior.
- **TypeScript Refactor:** Updated `database.types.ts` and domain models to strictly use UPPERCASE keys, improving type safety and reducing runtime errors.
- **Supabase Service Optimization:** Refactored `supabaseService.ts` to use standardized UPPERCASE identifiers in all queries and data mappings.

### Fixed
- **Build Stability:** Resolved TypeScript errors in `App.tsx` related to missing `ID` and `CREATED_AT` fields in the initial asset creation logic.
- **Auth Integration:** Fixed lowercase column references in the account deletion and user asset retrieval flows.

## [1.7.1] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed
- **Gemini Engine Connectivity:** Resolved an issue where the Gemini API key was not correctly detected in browser environments by adding support for `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`.

- **Environment Configuration:** Updated `.env.example` and `README.md` with the correct environment variable naming for client-side exposure.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Data Encryption:** Implemented client-side AES-GCM encryption for sensitive OCR text and document descriptions before cloud transmission.
