- **TypeScript Refactor:** Updated `database.types.ts` and domain models to strictly use UPPERCASE keys, improving type safety and reducing runtime errors.
- **Supabase Service Optimization:** Refactored `supabaseService.ts` to use standardized UPPERCASE identifiers in all queries and data mappings.

### Fixed
- **Build Stability:** Resolved TypeScript errors in `App.tsx` related to missing `ID` and `CREATED_AT` fields in the initial asset creation logic.
- **Auth Integration:** Fixed lowercase column references in the account deletion and user asset retrieval flows.

## [1.7.1] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed
- **Gemini Engine Connectivity:** Resolved an issue where the Gemini API key was not correctly detected in browser environments by adding support for `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **SDK Integration:** Fixed a schema mismatch in the `@google/genai` SDK by correctly wrapping the request contents in an array.
- **Environment Configuration:** Updated `.env.example` and `README.md` with the correct environment variable naming for client-side exposure.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Data Encryption:** Implemented client-side AES-GCM encryption for sensitive OCR text and document descriptions before cloud transmission.
- **Account Deletion:** Added a secure account deletion flow that removes all user-associated data from Supabase and the authentication system.
- **Web3 Transaction Logging:** Encrypted recording of on-chain minting events to the user's private cloud profile.
- **Automatic Cloud Sync:** Local assets are now automatically synchronized to the user's Supabase account upon login.

## [1.6.2] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Integrated `Toast` notifications for real-time feedback, `Skeleton` loading states for better perceived performance, and `ErrorBoundary` components with recovery options.
- **Onboarding Flow:** Added a 6-step interactive `Onboarding` guide to help new users navigate the GeoGraph ecosystem.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implemented a global `KeyboardShortcuts` listener (press `?` to toggle) for power-user navigation.

## [1.6.1] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Advanced PWA Features:** Implemented `file_handlers` for opening images/PDFs, `share_target` for receiving content from other apps, and `protocol_handlers` for `web+geograph://` deep links.
- **System Widgets:** Added Adaptive Card widgets (`status.json`) for Windows 11 and Android home screen integration.
- **Window Controls Overlay:** Enabled custom title bar area for a more native desktop application feel.
- **Asset Optimization:** Replaced SVG placeholders with high-quality PNG icons and screenshots in `public/` for better OS compatibility.

### Changed
- **Manifest Architecture:** Moved `manifest.json` and `sw.js` to `public/` root for correct scope resolution.
- **Cache Strategy:** Implemented aggressive cache busting (`v=3`) to ensure immediate propagation of PWA updates.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-01-07

### Added
- **Engine Upgrade:** Migrated to `gemini-2.5-flash` for blazing fast complex text reasoning and better entity extraction in messy scans.
- **Graph Visualizer Panning/Zooming:** Integrated `d3.zoom` into the `GraphVisualizer` component, enabling users to explore dense knowledge graphs via mouse/touch.
- **Structured DB Clusters:** Added a hierarchical "Cluster View" to the database tab, allowing grouping by Source, GIS Zone, Category, or Rights.
- **Cloud Refresh Logic:** Explicit "Refresh Cloud" button in Master View to force-pull latest dataframes from Supabase.
- **Relational Integrity:** Enhanced the Supabase fetching service to reconstruct D3-compatible nodes and links from flattened SQL records.

### Changed
- **Database Default View:** Set "Tabular View" as the default view for the database tab for better data density.
- **Metadata Labels:** Replaced the "Rights" column in the main database table with "Description" to prioritize semantic content visibility.
- **Collection Naming:** Integrated Gemini-suggested collection names to replace the generic "Batch Ingest" label.

### Fixed
- **Image Persistence:** Resolved a race condition where blob URLs were not being converted to permanent storage URLs fast enough for local persistence.
- **TypeScript Strictness:** Added missing types and `@ts-ignore` markers for `import.meta.env` access in non-Vite contexts.

## [1.5.1] - 2025-01-06
