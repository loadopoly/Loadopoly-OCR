# Privacy Policy — GeoGraph Node

**Last Updated: January 7, 2025**

GeoGraph Foundation ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes how we handle data within the GeoGraph Node application.

## 1. Local-First Design
GeoGraph Node is designed to be local-first. Initial image capture, OCR processing via API, and metadata creation occur on your device. Data is stored in your browser's **IndexedDB** until you choose to contribute it to the network.

## 2. Information We Collect
- **Images & Scans:** Used locally to perform AI analysis.
- **GIS Data:** If permitted, we collect GPS coordinates to geotag assets.
- **Relational Data:** AI generates nodes (people, places, concepts) from your scans.
- **Wallet Address:** If using Web3 features, we store your public address to manage NFT shards.

## 3. Data Contribution
By clicking "Earn Shard" or "Contribute," you voluntarily upload your data to the **GeoGraph Global Corpus**. 
- **Public Domain:** Individual contributions are dedicated to the public domain under the **CC0 1.0 Universal** license.
- **Global Visibility:** Contributed assets are visible to all users of the platform for exploration and dataset building.

## 4. Third-Party Services
- **Google Gemini API:** We send image data to Google for processing. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Supabase:** Used for cloud storage and relational database hosting.
- **Polygon Network:** Used for blockchain transactions if Web3 features are enabled.

## 5. Security
We use industry-standard encryption for data in transit to our Supabase repository. However, no internet-based system is 100% secure. 

## 6. Your Rights
- **Deletion:** You can clear your local repository at any time via the Settings panel.
- **Portability:** You can export your data in JSON format at any time.
